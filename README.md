# Edge-Device-Video-Generation

This project contains a collection of models i.e. PredRNN, ConvLSTM, and a ViT, as a study on feasibility of generating videos on the average edge computer device.
As per the specifications of the studying system:
24 GB DDR5 RAM
8GB VRAM GTX 4060
Ryzen 7

The generations have been limited and almost incoherent with the training data.
For more information, please access each of the files and try it out for yourself!
